First Commit:
In the first commit, I tried to just create a very simple todo app using Html & js. I wanted to primarily play around with the various js methods that `document` provides. These methods include like understanding the differences between .getElementById, .querySelector, and etc. I got to play around/read about the various methods and how they change the behavior.
