### Project Name: Stylesheet Toggle

I'm interested in trying to figure out how this CSS Demo was created using only one HTML page, but the styles change everytime. I wonder how the styles are able to switch or toggle around with the links being sent to another page.


**First Stylesheet**
The first stylesheet was really helpful to get more into the weeds of css. Rather than trying to search up how to do everything, I tried to force myself to either a) go through the w3schools list of CSS or b) tried to just mess around and see what would happen. I think these solutions are better because then I get to think more about how I am coding, rather than copying-pasting from stackoverflow.

Initially, it was daunting to do everything alone; however, once I started getting a certain understanding of everything (after reading a few of the documnets), it definitely got a bit easier.

The two biggest challenges that I will definitely encounter and have not yet figured out is a) how to style the lists without the space and b) how to make the list toggable between styles
