I'm interested in trying to figure out how this CSS Demo was created using only one HTML page, but the styles change everytime. I wonder how the styles are able to switch or toggle around with the links being sent to another page.


**First Stylesheet**
The first stylesheet was really helpful to get more into the weeds of css. Rather than trying to search up how to do everything, I tried to force myself to either a) go through the w3schools list of CSS or b) tried to just mess around and see what would happen. I think these solutions are better because then I get to think more about how I am coding, rather than copying-pasting from stackoverflow.

Initially, it was daunting to do everything alone; however, once I started getting a certain understanding of everything (after reading a few of the documnets), it definitely got a bit easier.

The two biggest challenges that I will definitely encounter and have not yet figured out is a) how to style the lists without the space and b) how to make the list toggable between styles

**Second Stylesheet**
The second stylesheet was definitely easier to change some things around. Instead of playing around with flex containers though, I was using a grid approach to move around the div's. It was frustrating and interesting to make everything out.

The biggest challenge that remains is to style the lists. This will continue to be repeated. I will address the CSS with the lists once I have completed the stylesheets and begin to learn how to toggle between them.

**Third Stylesheet**
The third stylesheet was pretty easy. It was very similar to the no-styles stylesheet; with a few different color options. My stylesheets will definitely change once I begin adding toggles; although, I'm not sure how it will change. I used the same principles from above about not searching up stuff I don't know, but rather finding it.

**Fourth Stylesheet**
The fourth stylesheet was also very similar to the second and third. I used a grid display; however, I think there might be a better approach to mimic the behavior of the W3Schools Stylesheet 4 that is listed. I'm going to invest this a bit further, but first, I plan to learn how to toggle between stylesheets.
