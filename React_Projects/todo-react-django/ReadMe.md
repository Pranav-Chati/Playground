### Premise of Project
The main premise of this project is too learn Django / React in a controlled manner. Following along this tutorial via DigitalOcean's website, I was able to ask various questions about the Django code that I was writing, along with the connection that exists to React. This will help me with the book-project because reverse-engineering this Todo-App will allow me to better understand how to write proper Django / React Code
