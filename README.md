## introduction
Hi, my name is Pranav. I see you have stumbled into my playground. This is an area where I just try to refine a lot of coding habits. Aka doing very simple things to get better at techniques, before I invest in a new repo for a project. Playground is learning space for me to mess around. 

Please Enjoy the various sections. I cannot emphasize this enough, but when you explore those projects and read the ReadMe's, those are often my pure thoughts in the moment when I was coding and trying to work through various solutions.

Thank you and have a great rest of your day!
