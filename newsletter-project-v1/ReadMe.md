** Name: Pranav Chati **
** Project: Newsletter Reader **

## Problem
When I begin to read a newsletter, there is always an associated learning curve. I often find myself going down various rabbit holes; find myself taking "notes" on certain phrases / sentences; and lastly, I feel as if my inbox gets so crowded.

## Soltuion
I want to build an application that solves my pain points and does three things:
a) Organizes all my newsletters that I am currently reading and notifs me when a newsletter has been dropped
b) Allows me to annotate and create "node-like" comments to function like an organized "rabbit-hole"
c) Downloads the html content from the email, and then deletes the gmail.


## v1:
In Version 1 of this project, I would like to make it a webapp. I would like to first mess around with trying to see how I can pull Email data from whatever resource whether that be via scraping the email or something else; and then see if I can make a navigation bar and organize each one.
